A major problem in metropolitan areas is traffic. Nowadays traffic density on the streets or lanes are increasing exponentially around the world. It causes several problems on the day to day life of people. This problem can be resolved by controlling the traffic density on the roads. We try to build a dynamic traffic control system by measuring the traffic density at the intersections by real time video feeds and image processing. According to the measured density software provides delay time to the microcontroller which controls the projector and thereby we can give appropriate traffic signal to display.
